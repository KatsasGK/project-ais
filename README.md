# PROJECT A.I.S.
Project-A.I.S ---> The future of A.I. and hacking combined ;)


---WHAT CAN I DO---
I'm an intelligent assisant which can chat with you, tell a story or a joke maybe even hack for you if i'm in mood, spoiler i'm always up for some hacking but i would prefer to tell you the weather.
So far i dont have a Graphical User Interface, the recommended way to use me is on  RASPBERRY PI through SSH connection.


---TOOLS I CAN USE---
"HACKING section" --> MDK3, WIRESHARK, PRISM-AP, WIFITE, NMAP, NET-DISCOVERY, WEBSITE-ANALYZE-SCRIPT.
"WEATHER section" --> WEATHER-SCRIPT_V1
"MUSIC section"   --> Simple-music-player


---FUTURE UPDATES---
IN V2 -> HACKING TOOLS OPTIMISATION(use custom versions instead for maximum performance and add more)
IN V3 -> ADD DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONNECT(make it portable)
